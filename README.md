# ludovico-api

## Getting started

This is a Java Springboot Application.  If you do not have Maven or Java installed, navigate to the ludovico parent project home directory and run the following:
 ```bash
 $ ./javaSetup.sh
 ```

After you run that command, come back to this directory and run the following:

```bash
$ mvn install
$ ./run.sh
```

That's it! The application natively is served on localhost:8080, and thus API calls can be accessed there.
